"""A simple thread pool for the Google Response Rig.

This file defines a simple thread pool that is used throughout this
project for parallelizing data store accesses. This thread pool is
rather lightweight and optimized to be used in combination with the
GRR data_store modules. It is not meant to be general purpose - if you
need a generalized thread pool, you should probably use a better
suited alternative implementation.

If during creation not all new worker threads can be spawned by the
ThreadPool, a log entry will be written but execution will continue
using a smaller pool of workers. In this case, consider reducing the
--threadpool_size.

Example usage:
>>> def PrintMsg(value):
>>>   print "Message: %s" % value
>>> for _ in range(10):
>>>   SharedPool().AddTask(PrintMsg, ("Hello World!", ))
>>> SharedPool().Join()
